# About

I'm a data analyst based in Colorado. When I'm not crunching data, I meditate and hike. I'm also a reader, interested in organizational psychology and design. I think the most valuable things you can get from an activity are the good qualities that are built into the mind. If I can become more determined, more patient, more generous while doing something, then I'm gaining something good. I want to work with people who value a job well done, who have integrity, and who don't mind mentoring me from time to time.

When I worked as a software engineer, one of my favorite things was building tools to automate or simplify repetitive tasks. I did this in [web applications](https://www.github.com/Iancam/reduxResources), and working with [bioinformaticians](https://www.github.com/Iancam/midstream). When I build something like that, I see the impact it has on my coworkers, and it feels good. Now that I'm becoming a data analyst, I've found a reward in uncovering business insights from data.[1](/posts/2024/10/18/Divvy-Case-Study)[2](/posts/2024/10/25/Bellabeat_case_study)

Currently open to remote opportunities in data analysis. I look forward to joining a team where I can contribute and grow in the field.
