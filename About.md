# About

Iâ€™ve been a software engineer, so I like solving complex problems. Now, I've fallen in love with data analysis and contributing to data-driven decision processes. I have experience identifying and automating repetitive tasks while building web applications and working with analysts. I enjoy using code to uncover actionable insights from data; as an engineer I analyzed performance metrics, and as an analyst I've worked with user behavior datasets to drive business decisions.

Despite my enjoyment of R, I know that Python is the more popular language, and I analyze data in both. I've got SQL chops, a strong understanding of databases, and I can cook up an interactive dashboard in Tableau as well. I enjoy simplifying complex data and translating it into meaningful stories that drive improvements. My background gives me a unique perspective on solving data challenges: I think a bit like a data engineer, considering how to turn my analyses into efficient, repeatable, and generalizable pipelines. I of course have a sense of when this consideration will actually bear fruit, and wouldn't do it for an ad-hoc analysis.

Currently open to remote opportunities in data analysis, I look forward to joining a team where I can contribute
to data-driven success while continuing to learn and grow in the field.
