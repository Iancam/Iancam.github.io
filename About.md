# About

I'm a data analyst based in Colorado. When I'm not crunching data, I meditate and hike. I think the most valuable things you can get from an activity are the good qualities that are built into the mind. If I can become more determined, more patient, more generous while doing something, then I'm gaining something good. I want to work with people who value a job well done, who have a bit of integrity, and who don't mind mentoring me from time to time.

When I worked as a software engineer, one of my favorite things was building tools to automate or simplify repetitive tasks. I did this in [web applications](https://www.github.com/Iancam/reduxResources), and working with [bioinformaticians](https://www.github.com/Iancam/midstream). When I build something like that, I see the impact it has on my coworkers, and it feels good. Now that I'm becoming a data analyst, I expect to find a similar reward in understanding business problems, and using data to help solve them.

Simply uncovering a business insight from data is fun too. When I analyzed [Chicago bikeshare data](/posts/2024/10/18/Divvy-Case-Study), I got a kick when I hypothesized and then found evidence for the idea that member bike riders are generally commuters, and casual bike riders are generally tourists and explorers. This meant someone trying to convert casual riders to member riders would want to focus on casual riders who lived within range to commute. A similar grouping insight came when looking at sedentary behavior in [fitbit data](/posts/2024/10/25/Bellabeat_case_study). There were two distinct groups, and the evidence indicated that the group with more sedentary time had desk jobs, and those with less had more active jobs.

Currently open to remote opportunities in data analysis. I look forward to joining a team where I can contribute and grow in the field.
