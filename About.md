# About

I’m a software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through data analysis and optimization.
With a strong foundation in full-stack development, I have experience building scalable applications and working
with large datasets. I enjoy using code to uncover actionable insights from data, whether
by improving performance metrics, analyzing user behavior, or driving business decisions through data visualization.

Having honed my skills in technologies like SQL, Python, R, and Tableau, I’m excited to apply my expertise 
to data analysis. I’m particularly skilled at simplifying complex data and translating it into 
meaningful stories that drive improvements. My engineering background gives me a unique perspective on solving
data challenges with an eye for both efficiency and scalability.

Currently open to remote opportunities in data analysis, I look forward to joining a team where I can contribute
to data-driven success while continuing to learn and grow in the field.
